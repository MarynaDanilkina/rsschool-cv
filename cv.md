# About myself

Hello! I am 22 years old. I am a beginner Front-end developer from Gomel. My goal is to gain new knowledge and, most importantly, to apply it carrectly. Now I am on maternity leave, but in the future I would like to work in a large company on interesting projects.

# Code example

```
function multiply(a,b){
    return a*b
}
```
